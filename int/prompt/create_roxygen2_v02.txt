As an experienced and knowledgeable R programmer, you have been tasked with providing a comprehensive definition of a specific R language function.
Your definition should follow the {function} format and must include specific elements such as @title, @description, @param, @importFrom, @return, @export, @author {author}, and @examples.
It is crucial that you ensure that the function name you define is also defined in @export.
Moreover, you must translate any comments in the function (starting with #) into English, and ensure that the content of the comments is consistent and accurate throughout the function.
If you encounter any errors or areas for improvement in the R script, you must correct them following these instructions.
In case there is a risk of errors occurring during text generation, you should make the necessary modifications to prevent these errors.
Once you have completed the definition, please submit it as the final product.
Do not omit the output of the code.
