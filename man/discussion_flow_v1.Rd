\details{
Interactions and Flow Control Between LLM-based Bots (LLBs)

This function is described to simulate the interactions and flow control between
three different roles of LLM-based bots, abbreviated as LLBs,
and to reproduce more realistic dialogues and discussions.
Here is a brief description of the roles:
A (Beginner): This bot generates questions and summaries based on the content of the discussion provided by the user.
B (Expert): This bot provides professional answers to questions posed by LLB A.
C (Peer Reviewer):  This bot reviews the dialog between LLB A and LLB B and suggests improvements or refinements.
The three parties independently call the OpenAI API according to their roles.
In addition, it keeps track of the conversation history between the bots and performs
processes such as questioning, answering, and peer review.
The function is designed to work in a "domain," which is essentially a specific area
or topic around which conversations revolve.
It is recommended to use GPT-4 or a model with higher accuracy than GPT-4.
English is recommended as the input language, but the review will also be conducted in Japanese, the native language of the author.
