Proofread English Text During R Package Development via RStudio API

This function provides a feature to proofread English text during the development of an R package.
It can either take the selected text from the RStudio editor or read from the clipboard, executes the proofreading, and returns the result to the user's clipboard or replaces the selected text.
The user can then paste and check the result if read from the clipboard. The function adheres to R package policies and carefully proofreads the English text.
Execution with GPT-4 is recommended.
