Description: The Large Language Model (LLM) represents a groundbreaking advancement 
    in data science and programming, and also allows us to extend the world of R. 
    A seamless interface for integrating the 'OpenAI' Web APIs into R is provided in this package. 
    This package leverages LLM-based AI techniques, enabling efficient knowledge discovery and data analysis 
    (see 'OpenAI' Web APIs details <https://openai.com/blog/openai-api>).
    The previous functions such as seamless translation and image generation have been moved 
    to other packages 'deepRstudio' and 'stableDiffusion4R'.
